Welcome to the source code for Android examples from the vogella.com online tutorials and books.

Using in Android Studio
=======================

Some of the projects should have a `build.gradle` file suitable for
importing the project into Android Studio. If not please send a pull request to add one.

Note, though, that you
may need to adjust the `compileSdkVersion` in `build.gradle` if it
requests an SDK that you have not downloaded and do not wish to
download. Similarly, you may need to adjust the `buildToolsVersion`
value to refer to a version of the "Build-tools" that you have downloaded
from the SDK Manager.

Using in Eclipse
================

Most of the projects can be imported using the normal Eclipse import process. 

- Some of these projects are not set up to support Eclipse, because
the nature of the project is to demonstrate something specific for
Android Studio or Gradle for Android.

- Some of these projects are not set up to support Eclipse, as Eclipse
is no longer officially enhanced by Google, and so new examples are developed with Android Studio.
